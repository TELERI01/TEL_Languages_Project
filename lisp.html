        LISP (LISt Processing) is a family of programming languages known for their unique syntax and powerful features for symbolic computing.
    </p>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        LISP was developed in the late 1950s by John McCarthy at MIT. It has undergone various dialects and implementations over the years.
    </p>
    <h2>Usage</h2>
    <p>
        LISP is used in artificial intelligence research, computer algebra systems, and other domains requiring symbolic computation and manipulation of symbolic expressions.
